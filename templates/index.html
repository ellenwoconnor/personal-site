    <h3>About me</h3>
    <div class='text'>
      <p>
       I am a linguist-turned-engineer who recently received my PhD in Linguistics from the University of Southern California. Although my expertise lies at the intersection of research, technology and education, I am always on the hunt   for new things to learn about.

        My doctoral work focuses on the syntax-semantics interface, gathering insights using formal modeling as well as behavioral and neurolinguistic experimentation. This work has been largely guided by questions about how semantic composition proceeds in online processing: what parts of the brain participate in composition? how do the mechanisms involved in combinatory semantics interface with other cognitive systems? when/why do online interpretations occasionally deviate from compositional and grammar-based   meanings?

        In my free time, I enjoy traveling, eating sweet things, playing competitive board games, and trying to get my website to display properly.
