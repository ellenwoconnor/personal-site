about_me = 'I am PhDa candidate at the University of Southern California Department of Linguistics who has explored language from all angles: teaching and learning languages (natural and programming languages alike); professional writing and editing; working in language technology; and studying the formal properties of grammar and their neural underpinnings. My expertise lies at the intersection of education, technology and research. My doctoral work focuses on the syntax-semantics interface, gathering insights using formal modeling as well as behavioral and neurolinguistic experimentation. This work has been largely guided by questions about how semantic composition proceeds in online processing: what parts of the brain participate in composition? how do the mechanisms involved in combinatory semantics interface with other cognitive systems? when/why do online interpretations occasionally deviate from compositional and grammar-based meanings? In my free time, I enjoy traveling, eating sweet things, playing competitive board games, and expanding my brain in new directions.'
